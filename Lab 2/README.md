# The Clock of Pi

## Part E.
### Modified clock - Netflix Subscription Clock

[netflix_clock.py](netflix_clock.py) was created by modifying screen_clock.py to keep track of months with a new unit, "netflixes". One Netflix is the monetary cost for one month of netflix. Watch your time and money wither away with this awesome display clock!

# Lab 2 Part 2

I updated the interface to induce the maximum amount of anxiety for the Netlix subscription money clock. Changes are logged below:

- Title updated to "Netflix Damage". Damage refers to the amount of money you're losing due to a subscription.
- Updated to 25 decimal places of of text split across 3 lines for a fast updates, so the user feels the maximum impact of a subscription on their wallet, even if this is fractions of a cent.
- The clock now updates every half second - more anxiety!
