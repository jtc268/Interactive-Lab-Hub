### Storyboard

1. User wants to go to bed, needs sleep now
2. Gets in bed
3. Tries to turn off light
3. Light turns red instead of turning off - error
4. Why? Because the front door isn't locked
6. Goes to lock front door
7. Light turns back to normal color so user can see when returning to bed
8. User returns to bed, and turns off light. Light turns off successfully since the front door is locked

### Sketch

### Reflections from acting out scenario:

  - Initially, I thought that the light should turn off after the door was locked, but I realized the person trying to go to sleep wouldn't be able to see when they were returning to bed.
  - When someone lays down to go to sleep, sometimes they need the light to stay on longer after they lay down. So I staged the switch close enough to reach from bed to simulate a lamp.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 

_Setting:_ 
This interaction is happening in a mock "bedroom" near my front door. The office chair is staged as a bed.

_Players:_ 
I am in the setting with my girlfriend. We both care about the front door being locked before bed for safety. We welcome the red light as a reminder if we completely forget. Sometimes I have to get up to check if the front door is locked and find that it is. This is bothersome not to know the status.

_Activity:_ 
The user going to bed is very tired and not thinking about all of their responsibilities as part of their routine to go to bed. Something as simple as locking the front door can be easily forgotton and become a safety issue. Building in a mechanism to prevent a safety issue (the front door being unlocked) is the goal.

_Goals:_
The goal of the player is go to bed safely. Safety means that the front door of the apartment is locked when sleeping.

\*\***Peer Feedback***\*\*
I received feedback from our Zoom breakout group during class, including TA Rei Lee, on the idea and a few people agreed this would be a valuable solution. People seemed to agree that forgetting to lock the front door can be common and having a reminder before bed would be valuable.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
  - When someone lays down to go to sleep, sometimes they need the light to stay on longer after they lay down. So I staged the switch close enough to reach from bed to simulate a lamp.
  - I found out the feedback from the light changing color must be near instant so the user would associate the action of turning off the light with the error. This was difficult to coordinate with my smart lights by controlling manually. I figured this could be easily be automatic in a final version.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
- Yes, Initially, I thought that the light should turn off after the door was locked, but I realized the person trying to go to sleep wouldn't be able to see when they were returning to bed.
- Maybe a color other than red could be better for this warning. Red seems like something is urgent and this is more of a warning. I was thinking of using yellow, but yellow was too close to the color of the ambient light we started with.
- I realized that maybe the user wouldn't know what the red light error was associated with and I thought it could be cool if a laser line highlighted the route to fix the error. e.g. a line that connected from where the user is laying (bed) to the door (lock). That way the system could be exapnded upon and trace more errors in the house.

## Part C. Prototype the device
- The chosen device was a philips hue smart light system in the end. I experimented with tinkerbelle as well.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
- Sometimes when restarting the application, the port wasn't freed. I had to learn how to free ports.

## Part D. Wizard the device
My collaborator, Jennie, manually controlled the philips hue smart lights in coordination with the user actions for the video.

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

## Part F. Record

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
My girlfriend, Jennie, was the videographer and light controller! Many thanks.

# Staging Interaction, Part 2

\*\***Peer Feedback***\*\*

"Great idea! one thing to consider is if you have roommates, that might become a privacy issue or might disturb someone's sleep."

"...I really like your design, and I think your design would be adopted by many of those who care about safety a lot. I can also see how versatile your design is from its potential to apply to all kinds of smart home safety alerts!

***Thoughts from feedback:***
The light turning red could annoy other roommates. If the final design only turns the light red in the bedroom of the person going to bed, and not the main hallway, this concern can be mitigated.

Applying a red light or different color lights depending on the home safety concern could be a great idea for iterations in the future!

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity.
